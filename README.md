## Matriculation Number:
7222017

## Project Description:
This Java project demonstrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism. It includes a hierarchy of classes where 'Vehicle' is a superclass with subclasses 'ICEV', 'BEV', and 'HybridV'. Each vehicle type has a 'Manufacture' and an 'Engine'. The solution showcases different vehicle types with varying engine configurations.

## Features:
- Vehicles of type 'ICEV', 'BEV', and 'HybridV'.
- Vehicles have engines of types 'CombustionEngine', 'ElectricEngine', and 'HybridEngine'.
- The project demonstrates polymorphism with the 'showCharacteristics()' method.

## Development Environment:
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2.1 (Community Edition)
- **JDK Version**: OpenJDK 17
- **Operating System**: Windows 11
